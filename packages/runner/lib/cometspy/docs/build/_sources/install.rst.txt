   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at
   least contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. The toctree directive controls what links are in the "Navigation" bar
   at the top of each page. The "maxdepth" argument determines how many
   levels deep the links are shown. The "caption" argument determines the
   title of the "Navigation" bar.
